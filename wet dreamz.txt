 
istg ya bitches is the same
but when i met this girl she really changed the game
i remeber when our eyes locked in i had the perfect aim
ik i do my fuck ups but i dont you to take the blame
i want you to know your the one i forever claim 
js know the love gonna be the same after the fame 
i dont wanna fuck up and end up w a lame
 i wanna live until i see you w my last name

i dont belivie on love at first sight 
but when i saw you ik you were my perfect type
You are my angel im chasing the light
 understand this song not perfect its coming off the mind
(uh)
Its something i wrote js to tell you how i feel inside
i gotta let you know our feeling our never gonna die
She so pretty even when she cries
But cant keep looking ima get lost in them eyes
(uh)
what if i told you how i really feel
what if i told you were the one who helped me heal
what if i told you were my favorite meal
what if i told you i will never leave even for a big deal
(uh)
